# Week 8 Progress Report

Ruiyang Gan

## Expected task to finish during last Week (Week , Feb 26 - Mar 02)

1. Finish testing the (faster) implementation of modularity computing algorithm

2. Finish writing the invariant of LPAb that involves using modularity in label selection criterion 

3. Wrap up the project (repository cleaning, writing README.md and Meta.md) and prepare for writing the tutorial

## What I actually did during last Week

1. Test the modularity function and found out that building a dictionary for lookup of 
million of edges is not a good idea

2. Start writing the tutorial on pyspark and graphframe

3. Try to deploy the code on the EMR cluster

## Obstacles I faced

1. Deploy code on distributed computing cluster seems to be more difficult than I expect
(dependency issue for other computing nodes)

## What I aim to complete this upcoming Week (Week 7, Mar 02 - Mar 08)

1. Finish the tutorial on pyspark and graphframe

2. Try deploying the code on the cloud and see whether it will run faster.
